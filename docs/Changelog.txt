1.0.0:
	. ConfigurationService component (both Spring and common variants)
	. loads parameters from a file on the file system,
	  or from a resource with default settings if that file is missing
	. allows to change the loglevel from that configuration file 
	  (no need to edit the logback.xml file inside the .jar file)
	. allows to configure a rotating log file as alternative to
	  the default logging to std out.
	. allows overriding configuration parameters (never use in production
	  unless you are sure about what you are doing: overridden configuration
	  parameters can no longer be set through the configuration file)

	. added Jenkins configuration
